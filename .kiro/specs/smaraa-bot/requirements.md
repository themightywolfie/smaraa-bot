# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SmaraaBot is a Discord bot that provides intelligent message archiving and AI-powered search capabilities. The bot allows users to archive important messages by replying and mentioning the bot, then enables semantic search and summarization of archived content using OpenAI embeddings and LLM capabilities. The system is built with Node.js/TypeScript, uses PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector storage, and integrates LangChain.js for retrieval-augmented generation workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord server member, I want to archive important messages by replying to them and mentioning the bot, so that valuable information can be preserved and searched later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user replies to any message and mentions SmaraaBot THEN the system SHALL archive the referenced message with full metadata
2. WHEN a message is archived THEN the system SHALL store the message content, author information, channel details, timestamp, and attachment metadata
3. WHEN the same message ID is archived multiple times THEN the system SHALL deduplicate and not create duplicate entries
4. WHEN archiving is successful THEN the bot SHALL respond with a confirmation message to the user
5. WHEN archiving fails due to permissions or technical issues THEN the bot SHALL provide a clear error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Discord server member, I want to use slash commands to archive messages and search archived content, so that I have multiple convenient ways to interact with the bot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uses `/archive` command as a reply to a message THEN the system SHALL archive the referenced message
2. WHEN a user uses `/search` command with a query THEN the system SHALL return semantically relevant archived messages
3. WHEN a user uses `/search` with filters (user, channel, date range) THEN the system SHALL apply those filters to the search results
4. WHEN a user uses `/summarize` command with a query THEN the system SHALL provide a concise summary of relevant archived messages
5. WHEN search results are returned THEN each result SHALL include message snippet, author, channel, timestamp, and deep link to original message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to configure role-based permissions for archiving and searching, so that I can control who can use these features in my server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin configures archive permissions THEN only users with specified roles SHALL be able to archive messages
2. WHEN an admin configures search permissions THEN only users with specified roles SHALL be able to search archived content
3. WHEN an admin sets visibility to "restricted" THEN users SHALL only see results from messages they have permission to view
4. WHEN an admin sets visibility to "public" THEN all authorized users SHALL see all archived messages in the server
5. WHEN permission checks fail THEN the bot SHALL respond with an appropriate permission denied message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to set data retention policies, so that I can manage storage costs and comply with data governance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin sets a retention period THEN messages older than the specified days SHALL be automatically deleted
2. WHEN retention cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL remove both message records and their vector embeddings
3. WHEN no retention period is set THEN messages SHALL be kept indefinitely
4. WHEN retention cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL log the cleanup activity for audit purposes
5. WHEN messages are deleted due to retention THEN the vector indexes SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user performing searches, I want fast and relevant results with semantic understanding, so that I can quickly find the information I need even with natural language queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search query is submitted THEN the system SHALL return results within 600ms at p95 latency for databases with up to 50k messages
2. WHEN performing semantic search THEN the system SHALL use vector similarity to find conceptually related content, not just keyword matches
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance score
4. WHEN multiple results are found THEN the system SHALL support pagination with navigation buttons
5. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful "no results" message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive observability and error handling, so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log structured events with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic for transient failures
3. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and queue requests appropriately
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN health check endpoints SHALL be available for monitoring
5. WHEN operations complete THEN metrics SHALL be recorded for archive count, search latency, and LLM usage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure authentication and authorization, so that the bot and backend services are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot communicates with the backend THEN it SHALL use a shared secret API key for authentication
2. WHEN backend services are deployed THEN they SHALL only accept HTTPS connections
3. WHEN database connections are established THEN they SHALL use least-privilege database roles
4. WHEN sensitive configuration is needed THEN secrets SHALL be stored in secure secret management systems
5. WHEN IP restrictions are configured THEN the backend SHALL only accept requests from allowlisted IP addresses

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Discord server member, I want message summarization capabilities, so that I can quickly understand the key points from multiple archived messages on a topic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a summary THEN the system SHALL retrieve the most relevant archived messages for the query
2. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL use LangChain.js with OpenAI LLM to create coherent summaries
3. WHEN a summary is provided THEN it SHALL include citations with message IDs for reference
4. WHEN summary generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior or error messaging
5. WHEN summaries are displayed THEN they SHALL include deep links to the original referenced messages

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle high availability and data consistency, so that users have a reliable experience and no data is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system restarts normally THEN no archived data SHALL be lost
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL be idempotent where possible to handle retries safely
3. WHEN the system shuts down THEN it SHALL gracefully drain in-flight requests before terminating
4. WHEN backups are needed THEN the system SHALL support regular automated backups with configurable retention
5. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support vertical scaling for the initial 50 guild target

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a Discord server member, I want attachment information to be preserved with archived messages, so that I can understand the full context of archived conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message with attachments is archived THEN attachment metadata SHALL be stored as JSON
2. WHEN displaying search results THEN attachment information SHALL be included in the result display
3. WHEN attachments are present THEN the system SHALL indicate their type and filename in results
4. WHEN attachment storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate messaging
5. WHEN attachments are referenced THEN deep links SHALL allow users to access the original attachments if still available
